With the rapid release of new language models, it is challenging to keep track. The latest language model that will be particularly interesting in the context of SAP AI Core is Llama2, with 7 billion parameters. The performance increase compared to other models in the category of 16gb VRAM and below is astonishing, in my opinion. This installment of the series “Running Language Models” will demonstrate the deployment of Llama2 and models of similar size on SAP BTP.
